# word-cloud
Generate an instant word cloud plot and download as PNG

## Why?
I wanted this for my portfolio
- to break down my skills stack for my resume, for myself
- to create something [simple to do](https://github.com/nodejavascript/word-cloud/tree/master/src/site)

## The problem
Too many sites do this with
- ads
- encouraging sign ups
- affiliate links
- tracking

## The solution
  - paste a paragraph
  - weight of words are based on distribution count
  - click to download as PDF

## Free and open-source software
