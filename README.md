# word-cloud
Generate an instant word cloud plot and download as PNG

## Why?
I wanted this for my portfolio
- to break down my skills stack for my resume, for myself
- to create something [simple to do](https://github.com/nodejavascript/word-cloud/tree/master/src/site)

## The problem
Too many sites do this with
- ads
- encouraging sign ups
- affiliate links

## The solution
- paste a paragraph
- weight of words are based on distribution count
- click to download as PDF

## Full disclosure
I have added google analytics because
  - if this sites gets some usage, I will be encourage to add feature
  - if features are used, I will enhance features

I will be measuring page views and button clicks ONLY. I am not interested in the content you submit, period!
